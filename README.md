# Flight Status Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts flight cancellations using historical flight data from 2018â€“2022. By leveraging data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, this project provides insights into the key factors influencing flight cancellations.

## Project Details

- **Tools Used**: Python, PySpark, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Logistic Regression.
- **Outputs**:
  - Processed dataset with engineered features.
  - Logistic regression model for flight cancellation predictions.
  - Visualizations illustrating data insights and model performance.
